      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin is a collection of computers, or nodes, that all run Bitcoin's code and store its blockchain. A blockchain can be thought of as a collection of blocks. In each block is a collection of transactions. Because all these computers running the blockchain have the same list of blocks and transactions and can transparently see these new blocks being filled with new Bitcoin transactions, no one can cheat the system.</p>

      <h2>Internal game theory</h2>
      <p>Game theory in cryptocurrency all has to do with incentives within the system, both good and bad. If you break a rule within the algorithmâ€™s system, there has to be a consequence that far outweighs the benefit. This is asymmetrical design, that disincentivises bad actors to work against a system.</p>

      <h2>Mining</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin mining refers to the process of digitally adding transaction records to the blockchain, which is a publicly distributed ledger holding the history of every bitcoin transaction. Mining is a record-keeping process executed through immense computing power. Each Bitcoin miner around the world contributes to a decentralized peer-to-peer network to ensure the payment network is trustworthy and secure.
